## danger
- couple unwraps and not too much error checking.
- might be prone to crashes. 
- freezes occasionally when copying files over the network
- better not specify too many "threads"

## why
- normal copy doesnt take into account files that were already copied in a previous attempt
- rsync is not as pretty
